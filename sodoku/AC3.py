    Compute AC3 constraint propagation on a constraint satisfaction problem

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    While YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO DO THIS, if we wanted to implement the
    maintaining arc consistency (MAC) algorithm, we could add two other
    arguments:
        queue - Allow a queue to be passed in as opposed to constructing
        one with variables that have constraints with respect to one another
        
        removals - List of values that have been restricted. As variables
        are eliminated, we would need to add to this list by calling
        csp.prune(var, value, removals) which would append to the list. 
    
    We could then call the backtracking algorithm with AC3 as the inference
    algorithm and MAC constraint propagation would work.
